## How to Write a First Program in C++

Many applications are running for specific tasks on computer every day. You might be curious about how to write such a program. One of popular programming lanugages is C++. Programs written in C++ language is generally faster and smaller than programs in the other languages.

To start writing a program in C++, you need two things.
- A text editor, like Notepad++, to write C++ source code
- A compiler, like Clang, GCC, VC to translate the C++ code into a machine language that the computer can understand.
